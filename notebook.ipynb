      "Answer: I can answer the question based on the provided context. In the context, a lambda function is a shorthand for defining a small anonymous function that can be used as an argument to a larger function or passed as a callback function to be called at a later time. The lambda function in this case takes two arguments, `log` and `page`, and returns a string that includes the page number and the log level.\n",
      "\n",
      "In more detail, a lambda function is a small anonymous function that can be defined inline within a larger expression or statement. It takes one or more arguments, which are passed to the function when it is called, and returns a value. Lambda functions are often used as callback functions or as arguments to other functions. They are particularly useful in situations where a small, simple function is needed, but the function does not need to be defined as a separate module or class.\n",

      "In the context provided, the lambda function is used to create a callback function that displays the page number and log level when the `download()` function is called.

      "Question: What is Dependency?\n",

Dependency injection is a technique used in code design to make it more testable, reusable, and open for extension. It involves referring to dependencies indirectly through abstract interfaces and providing them in a push rather than pull fashion.\n",

It is often used to create small, anonymous functions that can be used to simplify code or perform short-lived operations. The lambda function can take any number of arguments, just like a regular function, and can return a value.\\n\\nIn the context of the passage you provided, the lambda function is used in the `download()` function to create an anonymous function that calls the `print()` function with the downloaded file name as its argument. The lambda function is defined within the `download()` function, and it takes a single argument, `msg`, which is the message to be printed.\\n\\nThe use of lambda functions in this passage highlights one of their key benefits: they can be used to simplify code by eliminating the need for a separate function definition. In this case, the lambda function serves as a convenient way to call `print()` with the appropriate argument without having to define a separate function.',\n",
