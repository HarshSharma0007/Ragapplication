You\\ncan call print() multiple times like this to add vertical space.

Don’t confuse this with an empty line, which doesn’t contain any characters at all, not even the\\nnewline!\\nYou can use Python’s string literals to visualize these two:\\nThe first one is one character long, whereas the second one has no content.\\nIn a more common scenario, you’d want to communicate some message to the end user. There are a few ways to\\nachieve this.\\nFirst, you may pass a string literal directly to print():\\nThis will print the message verbatim onto the screen.\\nSecondly, you could extract that message into its own variable with a meaningful name to enhance readability and\\npromote code reuse:\\nLastly, you could pass an expression, like string concatenation, to be evaluated before printing the result:\\nIn fact, there are a dozen ways to format messages in Python.

Well, the short answer is that it doesn’t. It\\nimplicitly calls str() behind the scenes to type cast any object into a string. A\\x00erward, it treats strings in a uniform\\nway.\\nLater in this tutorial, you’ll learn how to use this mechanism for printing custom data types such as your classes.\\nOkay, you’re now able to call print() with a single argument or without any arguments. You know how to print fixed\\nor formatted messages onto the screen. The next subsection will expand on message formatting a little bit.\\nSeparating Multiple Arguments\\nYou saw print() called without any arguments to produce a blank line and then called with a single argument to\\ndisplay either a fixed or a formatted message.\\nHowever, it turns out that this function can accept any number of positional arguments, including zero, one, or more\\narguments. That’s very handy in a common case of message formatting, where you’d want to join a few elements\\ntogether.\\nLet’s have a look at this example:\\nprint() concatenated all four arguments passed to it, and it inserted a single space between them so that you didn’t\\nend up with a squashed message like \\'My name isjdoeand I am42\\'.\\nNotice that it also took care of proper type casting by implicitly calling str() on each argument before joining them\\ntogether. If you recall from the previous subsection, a naïve concatenation may easily result in an error due to\\nincompatible types:\\nApart from accepting a variable number of positional arguments, print() defines four named or keyword\\narguments, which are optional since they all have default values. You can view their brief documentation by calling\\nhelp(print) from the interactive interpreter.\\nLet’s focus on sep just for now. It stands for separator and is assigned a single space (\\' \\') by default. It determines the\\nvalue to join elements with.\\nIt has to be either a string or None, but the latter has the same e\\x00ect as the default space:\\nPython >>>\\n>>> print(None)\\nNone\\nShow/HideSyntax in Python 2\\nShow/HidePositional Arguments\\nPython >>>\\n>>> import os\\n>>> print(\\'My name is\\', os.getlogin(), \\'and I am\\', 42)\\nMy name is jdoe and I am 42\\nPython >>>\\n>>> print(\\'My age is: \\' + 42)\\nTraceback (most recent call last): \\n  File \"<input>\", line 1, in <module> \\n    print(\\'My age is: \\' + 42)\\nTypeError: can only concatenate str (not \"int\") to str\\nPython >>>'),\n",

In that case, simply pass the escaped newline character\\ndescribed earlier:\\nA more useful example of the sep parameter would be printing something like file paths:\\nRemember that the separator comes between the elements, not around them, so you need to account for that in one\\nway or another:\\nSpecifically, you can insert a slash character (/) into the first positional argument, or use an empty string as the first\\nargument to enforce the leading slash.\\nOne more interesting example could be exporting data to a comma-separated values (CSV) format:\\n>>> print(\\'hello\\', \\'world\\', sep=None)\\nhello world\\n>>> print(\\'hello\\', \\'world\\', sep=\\' \\')\\nhello world\\n>>> print(\\'hello\\', \\'world\\')\\nhello world\\nPython >>>\\n>>> print(\\'hello\\', \\'world\\', sep=\\'\\')\\nhelloworld\\nPython >>>\\n>>> print(\\'hello\\', \\'world\\', sep=\\'\\\\n\\')\\nhello\\nworld\\nPython >>>\\n>>> print(\\'home\\', \\'user\\', \\'documents\\', sep=\\'/\\')\\nhome/user/documents\\nPython >>>\\n>>> print(\\'/home\\', \\'user\\', \\'documents\\', sep=\\'/\\')\\n/home/user/documents\\n>>> print(\\'\\', \\'home\\', \\'user\\', \\'documents\\', sep=\\'/\\')\\n/home/user/documents\\nNote: Be careful about joining elements of a list or tuple.\\nDoing it manually will result in a well-known TypeError if at least one of the elements isn’t a string:\\nIt’s safer to just unpack the sequence with the star operator (*) and let print() handle type casting:\\nUnpacking is e\\x00ectively the same as calling print() with individual elements of the list.\\nPython >>>\\n>>> print(\\' \\'.join([\\'jdoe is\\', 42, \\'years old\\']))\\nTraceback (most recent call last): \\n  File \"<input>\", line 1, in <module> \\n    print(\\',\\'.join([\\'jdoe is\\', 42, \\'years old\\']))\\nTypeError: sequence item 1: expected str instance, int found\\nPython >>>\\n>>> print(*[\\'jdoe is\\', 42, \\'years old\\'])\\njdoe is 42 years old'),\n",

You can join elements with strings of any length:\\nIn the upcoming subsections, you’ll explore the remaining keyword arguments of the print() function.\\nPreventing Line Breaks\\nSometimes you don’t want to end your message with a trailing newline so that subsequent calls to print() will\\ncontinue on the same line. Classic examples include updating the progress of a long-running operation or prompting\\nthe user for input. In the latter case, you want the user to type in the answer on the same line:\\nMany programming languages expose functions similar to print() through their standard libraries, but they let you\\ndecide whether to add a newline or not. For example, in Java and C#, you have two distinct functions, while other\\nlanguages require you to explicitly append \\\\n at the end of a string literal.\\nHere are a few examples of syntax in such languages:\\nLanguage Example\\nPerl print \"hello world\\\\n\"\\nC printf(\"hello world\\\\n\");\\nC++ std::cout << \"hello world\" << std::endl;\\nIn contrast, Python’s print() function always adds \\\\n without asking, because that’s what you want in most cases. To\\ndisable it, you can take advantage of yet another keyword argument, end, which dictates what to end the line with.\\nIn terms of semantics, the end parameter is almost identical to the sep one that you saw earlier:\\nIt must be a string or None.\\nIt can be arbitrarily long.\\nIt has a default value of \\'\\\\n\\'.\\nIf equal to None, it’ll have the same e\\x00ect as the default value.\\nIf equal to an empty string (\\'\\'), it’ll suppress the newline.\\nNow you understand what’s happening under the hood when you’re calling print() without arguments. Since you\\ndon’t provide any positional arguments to the function, there’s nothing to be joined, and so the default separator isn’t\\nused at all. However, the default value of end still applies, and a blank line shows up.\\nPython >>>\\n>>> print(1, \\'Python Tricks\\', \\'Dan Bader\\', sep=\\',\\')\\n1,Python Tricks,Dan Bader\\nPython >>>\\n>>> print(\\'node\\', \\'child\\', \\'child\\', sep=\\' -> \\')\\nnode -> child -> child\\nShow/HideSyntax in Python 2\\nText\\nAre you sure you want to do this?

Some\\nstreams, however, bu\\x00er certain I/O operations to enhance performance, which can get in the way. Let’s take a look at\\nan example.\\nImagine you were writing a countdown timer, which should append the remaining time to the same line every\\nsecond:\\nYour first attempt may look something like this:\\nAs long as the countdown variable is greater than zero, the code keeps appending text without a trailing newline and\\nthen goes to sleep for one second. Finally, when the countdown is finished, it prints Go! and terminates the line.\\nUnexpectedly, instead of counting down every second, the program idles wastefully for three seconds, and then\\nsuddenly prints the entire line at once:\\nThat’s because the operating system bu\\x00ers subsequent writes to the standard output in this case. You need to know\\nthat there are three kinds of streams with respect to bu\\x00ering:\\n1. Unbu\\x00ered\\n2. Line-bu\\x00ered\\n3. Block-bu\\x00ered\\nUnbu\\x00ered is self-explanatory, that is, no bu\\x00ering is taking place, and all writes have immediate e\\x00ect. A line-\\nbu\\x00ered stream waits before firing any I/O calls until a line break appears somewhere in the bu\\x00er, whereas a block-\\nbu\\x00ered one simply allows the bu\\x00er to fill up to a certain size regardless of its content. Standard output is both line-\\nbu\\x00ered and block-bu\\x00ered, depending on which event comes first.\\nBu\\x00ering helps to reduce the number of expensive I/O calls. Think about sending messages over a high-latency\\nnetwork, for example. When you connect to a remote server to execute commands over the SSH protocol, each of\\nyour keystrokes may actually produce an individual data packet, which is orders of magnitude bigger than its\\npayload. What an overhead! It would make sense to wait until at least a few characters are typed and then send them\\ntogether. That’s where bu\\x00ering steps in.\\nOn the other hand, bu\\x00ering can sometimes have undesired e\\x00ects as you just saw with the countdown example. To\\nfix it, you can simply tell print() to forcefully flush the stream without waiting for a newline character in the bu\\x00er\\nusing its flush flag:\\nText\\n3...2...1...Go! \\nPython\\nimport time \\n \\nnum_seconds = 3\\nfor countdown in reversed(range(num_seconds + 1)): \\n    if countdown > 0: \\n        print(countdown, end='...') \\n        time.sleep(1) \\n    else: \\n        print('Go!')\\nPython\"),\n",

At this point, you’ve seen examples of calling print() that cover all of its parameters. You know their\\npurpose and when to use them. Understanding the signature is only the beginning, however. In the upcoming\\nsections, you’ll see why.\\nPrinting Custom Data Types\\nUp until now, you only dealt with built-in data types such as strings and numbers, but you’ll o\\x00en want to print your\\nown abstract data types. Let’s have a look at di\\x00erent ways of defining them.\\nFor simple objects without any logic, whose purpose is to carry data, you’ll typically take advantage of namedtuple,\\nwhich is available in the standard library. Named tuples have a neat textual representation out of the box:\\nThat’s great as long as holding data is enough, but in order to add behaviors to the Person type, you’ll eventually need\\nto define a class. Take a look at this example:\\nIf you now create an instance of the Person class and try to print it, you’ll get this bizarre output, which is quite\\ndi\\x00erent from the equivalent namedtuple:\\nIt’s the default representation of objects, which comprises their address in memory, the corresponding class name\\nand a module in which they were defined. You’ll fix that in a bit, but just for the record, as a quick workaround you\\ncould combine namedtuple and a custom class through inheritance:\\nYour Person class has just become a specialized kind of namedtuple with two attributes, which you can customize.\\nprint(countdown, end='...', flush=True)\\nShow/HideSyntax in Python 2\\nPython >>>\\n>>> from collections import namedtuple\\n>>> Person = namedtuple('Person', 'name age')\\n>>> jdoe = Person('John Doe', 42)\\n>>> print(jdoe)\\nPerson(name='John Doe', age=42)\\nPython\\nclass Person: \\n    def __init__(self, name, age): \\n        self.name, self.age = name, age\\nPython >>>\\n>>> jdoe = Person('John Doe', 42)\\n>>> print(jdoe)\\n<__main__.Person object at 0x7fcac3fed1d0>\\nPython\\nfrom collections import namedtuple \\n \\nclass Person(namedtuple('Person', 'name age')): \\n    pass\\nNote: In Python 3, the pass statement can be replaced with the ellipsis (...) literal to indicate a placeholder:\\nPython\"),\n",

However, it solves one problem while introducing another. Remember that\\ntuples, including named tuples, are immutable in Python, so they can’t change their values once created.\\nIt’s true that designing immutable data types is desirable, but in many cases, you’ll want them to allow for change, so\\nyou’re back with regular classes again.\\nFrom earlier subsections, you already know that print() implicitly calls the built-in str() function to convert its\\npositional arguments into strings. Indeed, calling str() manually against an instance of the regular Person class yields\\nthe same result as printing it:\\nstr(), in turn, looks for one of two magic methods within the class body, which you typically implement. If it doesn’t\\nfind one, then it falls back to the ugly default representation. Those magic methods are, in order of search:\\n1. def __str__(self)\\n2. def __repr__(self)\\nThe first one is recommended to return a short, human-readable text, which includes information from the most\\nrelevant attributes. A\\x00er all, you don’t want to expose sensitive data, such as user passwords, when printing objects.\\nHowever, the other one should provide complete information about an object, to allow for restoring its state from a\\nstring. Ideally, it should return valid Python code, so that you can pass it directly to eval():\\nThis prevents the interpreter from raising IndentationError due to missing indented block of code.\\ndef delta(a, b, c): \\n    ...\\nNote: Following other languages and frameworks, Python 3.7 introduced data classes, which you can think of as\\nmutable tuples.

More specifically, it’s a built-in function, which means that you\\ndon’t need to import it from anywhere:\\nIt’s always available in the global namespace so that you can call it directly, but you can also access it through a\\nmodule from the standard library:\\nThis way, you can avoid name collisions with custom functions. Let’s say you wanted to redefine print() so that it\\ndoesn’t append a trailing newline. At the same time, you wanted to rename the original function to something like\\nprintln():\\nNow you have two separate printing functions just like in the Java programming language. You’ll define custom\\nprint() functions in the mocking section later as well. Also, note that you wouldn’t be able to overwrite print() in the\\nfirst place if it wasn’t a function.\\nOn the other hand, print() isn’t a function in the mathematical sense, because it doesn’t return any meaningful value\\nother than the implicit None:\\nSuch functions are, in fact, procedures or subroutines that you call to achieve some kind of side-e\\x00ect, which\\nultimately is a change of a global state. In the case of print(), that side-e\\x00ect is showing a message on the standard\\noutput or writing to a file.\\nBecause print() is a function, it has a well-defined signature with known attributes. You can quickly find its\\ndocumentation using the editor of your choice, without having to remember some weird syntax for performing a\\ncertain task.\\nBesides, functions are easier to extend. Adding a new feature to a function is as easy as adding another keyword\\nargument, whereas changing the language to support that new feature is much more cumbersome. Think of stream\\nredirection or bu\\x00er flushing, for example.\\nAnother benefit of print() being a function is composability. Functions are so-called first-class objects or first-class\\ncitizens in Python, which is a fancy way of saying they’re values just like strings or numbers. This way, you can assign a\\nfunction to a variable, pass it to another function, or even return one from another. print() isn’t di\\x00erent in this\\nregard. For instance, you can take advantage of it for dependency injection:\\nPython >>>\\n>>> print\\n<built-in function print>\\nPython >>>\\n>>> import builtins\\n>>> builtins.print\\n<built-in function print>\\nPython >>>\\n>>> import builtins\\n>>> println = builtins.print\\n>>> def print(*args, **kwargs):\\n...     builtins.print(*args, **kwargs, end='')\\n...\\n>>> println('hello')\\nhello\\n>>> print('hello\\\\n')\\nhello\\nPython >>>\\n>>> value = print('hello world')\\nhello world\\n>>> print(value)\\nNone\\nPython\"),\n",

That means you can mix them with expressions, in particular, lambda\\nexpressions.

The latter is evaluated to a single value that can\\nbe assigned to a variable or passed to a function. In the example above, you’re interested in the side-e\\x00ect rather than\\nthe value, which evaluates to None, so you simply ignore it.\\nAs you can see, functions allow for an elegant and extensible solution, which is consistent with the rest of the\\nlanguage. In the next subsection, you’ll discover how not having print() as a function caused a lot of headaches.\\nPrint Was a Statement in Python 2\\nA statement is an instruction that may evoke a side-e\\x00ect when executed but never evaluates to a value. In other\\nwords, you wouldn’t be able to print a statement or assign it to a variable like this:\\nThat’s a syntax error in Python 2.\\nHere are a few more examples of statements in Python:\\nassignment: =\\nconditional: if\\nloop: while\\nassertion: assert\\nStatements are usually comprised of reserved keywords such as if, for, or print that have fixed meaning in the\\nlanguage. You can’t use them to name your variables or other symbols. That’s why redefining or mocking the print\\nstatement isn’t possible in Python 2. You’re stuck with what you get.\\nFurthermore, you can’t print from anonymous functions, because statements aren’t accepted in lambda expressions:\\nPython >>>\\n>>> user = 'jdoe'\\n>>> print('Hi!') if user is None else print(f'Hi, {user}.')\\nHi, jdoe.\\nPython\\nresult = print 'hello world'\\nNote: Python 3.8 brings a controversial walrus operator (:=), which is an assignment expression. With it, you\\ncan evaluate an expression and assign the result to a variable at the same time, even within another expression!\\nTake a look at this example, which calls an expensive function once and then reuses the result for further\\ncomputation:\\nThis is useful for simplifying the code without losing its e\\x00iciency. Typically, performant code tends to be more\\nverbose:\\nThe controversy behind this new piece of syntax caused a lot of argument. An abundance of negative comments\\nand heated debates eventually led Guido van Rossum to step down from the Benevolent Dictator For Life or\\nBDFL position.\\nPython\\n# Python 3.8+\\nvalues = [y := f(x), y**2, y**3]\\nPython\\ny = f(x)\\nvalues = [y, y**2, y**3]\\nPython >>>\"),\n",

Knowing this will surely help you become a better Python programmer.\\nPrinting With Style\\nIf you thought that printing was only about lighting pixels up on the screen, then technically you’d be right. However,\\nthere are ways to make it look cool. In this section, you’ll find out how to format complex data structures, add colors\\nand other decorations, build interfaces, use animation, and even play sounds with text!\\nPretty-Printing Nested Data Structures\\nComputer languages allow you to represent data as well as executable code in a structured way. Unlike Python,\\nhowever, most languages give you a lot of freedom in using whitespace and formatting. This can be useful, for\\nexample in compression, but it sometimes leads to less readable code.\\nPretty-printing is about making a piece of data or code look more appealing to the human eye so that it can be\\nunderstood more easily. This is done by indenting certain lines, inserting newlines, reordering elements, and so forth.\\nPython comes with the pprint module in its standard library, which will help you in pretty-printing large data\\nstructures that don’t fit on a single line. Because it prints in a more human-friendly way, many popular REPL tools,\\nincluding JupyterLab and IPython, use it by default in place of the regular print() function.\\nTo find out exactly what features are available to you, inspect the module:\\nYou could also call dir(__future__), but that would show a lot of uninteresting internal details of the module.\\nPython >>>\\n>>> import __future__\\n>>> __future__.all_feature_names\\n['nested_scopes',\\n 'generators',\\n 'division',\\n 'absolute_import',\\n 'with_statement',\\n 'print_function',\\n 'unicode_literals']\\nPython\\nfrom __future__ import print_function\\nPython >>>\\n>>> from __future__ import print_function\\n>>> import sys\\n>>> print('I am a function in Python', sys.version_info.major)\\nI am a function in Python 2\\n\\uf05a  Remove ads\"),\n",

Until recently, the Windows operating\\nsystem was a notable exception. Therefore, if you want the best portability, use the colorama library in Python. It\\ntranslates ANSI codes to their appropriate counterparts in Windows while keeping them intact in other operating\\nsystems.\\nTo check if your terminal understands a subset of the ANSI escape sequences, for example, related to colors, you can\\ntry using the following command:\\nMy default terminal on Linux says it can display 256 distinct colors, while xterm gives me only 8. The command would\\nreturn a negative number if colors were unsupported.\\nANSI escape sequences are like a markup language for the terminal. In HTML you work with tags, such as <b> or <i>, to\\nchange how elements look in the document. These tags are mixed with your content, but they’re not visible\\nthemselves. Similarly, escape codes won’t show up in the terminal as long as it recognizes them. Otherwise, they’ll\\nappear in the literal form as if you were viewing the source of a website.\\nAs its name implies, a sequence must begin with the non-printable Esc character, whose ASCII value is 27,\\nsometimes denoted as 0x1b in hexadecimal or 033 in octal. You may use Python number literals to quickly verify it’s\\nindeed the same number:\\nAdditionally, you can obtain it with the \\\\e escape sequence in the shell:\\nThe most common ANSI escape sequences take the following form:\\nElement Description Example\\nEsc non-printable escape character \\\\033\\n[ opening square bracket [\\nnumeric code one or more numbers separated with ; 0\\ncharacter code uppercase or lowercase letter m\\nThe numeric code can be one or more numbers separated with a semicolon, while the character code is just one\\nletter.

Some terminals make\\na sound whenever they see it.\\nSimilarly, you can print this character in Python. Perhaps in a loop to form some kind of melody. While it’s only a\\nsingle note, you can still vary the length of pauses between consecutive instances. That seems like a perfect toy for\\nMorse code playback!\\nThe rules are the following:\\nLetters are encoded with a sequence of dot (·) and dash (–) symbols.\\nA dot is one unit of time.\\nA dash is three units of time.\\nIndividual symbols in a letter are spaced one unit of time apart.\\nSymbols of two adjacent letters are spaced three units of time apart.\\nSymbols of two adjacent words are spaced seven units of time apart.\\nAccording to those rules, you could be “printing” an SOS signal indefinitely in the following way:\\nfrom time import sleep \\n \\ndef progress(percent=0, width=30): \\n    left = width * percent // 100 \\n    right = width - left \\n    print(\\'\\\\r[\\', \\'#\\' * left, \\' \\' * right, \\']\\', \\n          f\\' {percent:.0f}%\\', \\n          sep=\\'\\', end=\\'\\', flush=True) \\n \\nfor i in range(101): \\n    progress(i) \\n    sleep(0.1)\\nNote: There’s a feature-rich progressbar2 library, along with a few other similar tools, that can show progress in\\na much more comprehensive way.\\nShell\\n$ echo -e \"\\\\a\"\\nPython'),\n",

If you aspire to become a professional,\\nyou must learn how to test your code.\\nSo\\x00ware testing is especially important in dynamically typed languages, such as Python, which don’t have a compiler\\nto warn you about obvious mistakes. Defects can make their way to the production environment and remain dormant\\nfor a long time, until that one day when a branch of code finally gets executed.\\nSure, you have linters, type checkers, and other tools for static code analysis to assist you. But they won’t tell you\\nwhether your program does what it’s supposed to do on the business level.\\nSo, should you be testing print()? No. A\\x00er all, it’s a built-in function that must have already gone through a\\ncomprehensive suite of tests. What you want to test, though, is whether your code is calling print() at the right time\\nwith the expected parameters. That’s known as a behavior.\\nYou can test behaviors by mocking real objects or functions.

First, you can take the traditional path of statically-typed languages by\\nemploying dependency injection. This may sometimes require you to change the code under test, which isn’t always\\npossible if the code is defined in an external library:\\nThis is the same example I used in an earlier section to talk about function composition. It basically allows for\\nsubstituting print() with a custom function of the same interface. To check if it prints the right message, you have to\\nintercept it by injecting a mocked function:\\nCalling this mock makes it save the last message in an attribute, which you can inspect later, for example in an assert\\nstatement.\\nIn a slightly alternative solution, instead of replacing the entire print() function with a custom wrapper, you could\\nredirect the standard output to an in-memory file-like stream of characters:\\nThis time the function explicitly calls print(), but it exposes its file parameter to the outside world.\\nHowever, a more Pythonic way of mocking objects takes advantage of the built-in mock module, which uses a\\ntechnique called monkey patching. This derogatory name stems from it being a “dirty hack” that you can easily shoot\\nyourself in the foot with. It’s less elegant than dependency injection but definitely quick and convenient.\\nNote: You might have heard the terms: dummy, fake, stub, spy, or mock used interchangeably. Some people\\nmake a distinction between them, while others don’t.\\nMartin Fowler explains their di\\x00erences in a short glossary and collectively calls them test doubles.\\nPython\\ndef download(url, log=print): \\n    log(f'Downloading {url}') \\n    # ...\\nPython >>>\\n>>> def mock_print(message):\\n...     mock_print.last_message = message\\n...\\n>>> download('resource', mock_print)\\n>>> assert 'Downloading resource' == mock_print.last_message\\nPython >>>\\n>>> def download(url, stream=None):\\n...     print(f'Downloading {url}', file=stream)\\n...     # ...\\n...\\n>>> import io\\n>>> memory_buffer = io.StringIO()\\n>>> download('app.js', memory_buffer)\\n>>> download('style.css', memory_buffer)\\n>>> memory_buffer.getvalue()\\n'Downloading app.js\\\\nDownloading style.css\\\\n'\\nNote: The mock module got absorbed by the standard library in Python 3, but before that, it was a third-party\\npackage. You had to install it separately:\\nOther than that, you referred to it as mock, whereas in Python 3 it’s part of the unit testing module, so you must\\nimport from unittest.mock.\\nShell\\n$ pip2 install mock\"),\n",

Such a change is visible globally, so it\\nmay have unwanted consequences. In practice, however, patching only a\\x00ects the code for the duration of test\\nexecution.\\nTo mock print() in a test case, you’ll typically use the @patch decorator and specify a target for patching by referring\\nto it with a fully qualified name, that is including the module name:\\nThis will automatically create the mock for you and inject it to the test function. However, you need to declare that\\nyour test function accepts a mock now. The underlying mock object has lots of useful methods and attributes for\\nverifying behavior.\\nDid you notice anything peculiar about that code snippet?\\nDespite injecting a mock to the function, you’re not calling it directly, although you could. That injected mock is only\\nused to make assertions a\\x00erward and maybe to prepare the context before running the test.\\nIn real life, mocking helps to isolate the code under test by removing dependencies such as a database connection.\\nYou rarely call mocks in a test, because that doesn’t make much sense. Rather, it’s other pieces of code that call your\\nmock indirectly without knowing it.\\nHere’s what that means:\\nThe code under test is a function that prints a greeting. Even though it’s a fairly simple function, you can’t test it easily\\nbecause it doesn’t return a value. It has a side-e\\x00ect.\\nTo eliminate that side-e\\x00ect, you need to mock the dependency out. Patching lets you avoid making changes to the\\noriginal function, which can remain agnostic about print(). It thinks it’s calling print(), but in reality, it’s calling a\\nmock you’re in total control of.\\nThere are many reasons for testing so\\x00ware. One of them is looking for bugs. When you write tests, you o\\x00en want to\\nget rid of the print() function, for example, by mocking it away. Paradoxically, however, that same function can help\\nyou find bugs during a related process of debugging you’ll read about in the next section.\\nPrint Debugging\\nPython\\nfrom unittest.mock import patch \\n \\n@patch('builtins.print')\\ndef test_print(mock_print): \\n    print('not a real print') \\n    mock_print.assert_called_with('not a real print')\\nPython\\nfrom unittest.mock import patch \\n \\ndef greet(name): \\n    print(f'Hello, {name}!') \\n \\n@patch('builtins.print')\\ndef test_greet(mock_print): \\n    greet('John') \\n    mock_print.assert_called_with('Hello, John!')\\nShow/HideSyntax in Python 2\"),\n",

A\\x00er reading it, you’ll be able to make an educated\\ndecision about which of them is the most suitable in a given situation.\\nTracing\\nAlso known as print debugging or caveman debugging, it’s the most basic form of debugging. While a little bit old-\\nfashioned, it’s still powerful and has its uses.\\nThe idea is to follow the path of program execution until it stops abruptly, or gives incorrect results, to identify the\\nexact instruction with a problem. You do that by inserting print statements with words that stand out in carefully\\nchosen places.\\nTake a look at this example, which manifests a rounding error:\\nAs you can see, the function doesn’t return the expected value of 0.1, but now you know it’s because the sum is a little\\no\\x00. Tracing the state of variables at di\\x00erent steps of the algorithm can give you a hint where the issue is.\\nThis method is simple and intuitive and will work in pretty much every programming language out there. Not to\\nmention, it’s a great exercise in the learning process.\\nOn the other hand, once you master more advanced techniques, it’s hard to go back, because they allow you to find\\nbugs much quicker. Tracing is a laborious manual process, which can let even more errors slip through. The build and\\ndeploy cycle takes time. A\\x00erward, you need to remember to meticulously remove all the print() calls you made\\nwithout accidentally touching the genuine ones.\\nBesides, it requires you to make changes in the code, which isn’t always possible. Maybe you’re debugging an\\napplication running in a remote web server or want to diagnose a problem in a post-mortem fashion. Sometimes you\\nsimply don’t have access to the standard output.\\nThat’s precisely where logging shines.\\nLogging\\nLet’s pretend for a minute that you’re running an e-commerce website. One day, an angry customer makes a phone\\ncall complaining about a failed transaction and saying he lost his money. He claims to have tried purchasing a few\\nitems, but in the end, there was some cryptic error that prevented him from finishing that order. Yet, when he checked\\nhis bank account, the money was gone.\\nYou apologize sincerely and make a refund, but also don’t want this to happen again in the future. How do you debug\\nthat? If only you had some trace of what happened, ideally in the form of a chronological list of events with their\\ncontext.\\nNote: Debugging is the process of looking for the root causes of bugs or defects in so\\x00ware a\\x00er they’ve been\\ndiscovered, as well as taking steps to fix them.\\nThe term bug has an amusing story about the origin of its name.\\nPython >>>\\n>>> def average(numbers):\\n...     print('debug1:', numbers)\\n...     if len(numbers) > 0:\\n...         print('debug2:', sum(numbers))\\n...         return sum(numbers) / len(numbers)\\n...\\n>>> 0.1 == average(3*[0.1])\\ndebug1: [0.1, 0.1, 0.1]\\ndebug2: 0.30000000000000004\\nFalse\\nShow/HideRounding Error\"),\n",

This may help in\\nsituations like this, when you need to analyze a problem a\\x00er it happened, in an environment that you don’t have\\naccess to.\\nThere are sophisticated tools for log aggregation and searching, but at the most basic level, you can think of logs as\\ntext files. Each line conveys detailed information about an event in your system. Usually, it won’t contain personally\\nidentifying information, though, in some cases, it may be mandated by law.\\nHere’s a breakdown of a typical log record:\\nAs you can see, it has a structured form. Apart from a descriptive message, there are a few customizable fields, which\\nprovide the context of an event. Here, you have the exact date and time, the log level, the logger name, and the thread\\nname.\\nLog levels allow you to filter messages quickly to reduce noise. If you’re looking for an error, you don’t want to see all\\nthe warnings or debug messages, for example. It’s trivial to disable or enable messages at certain log levels through\\nthe configuration, without even touching the code.\\nWith logging, you can keep your debug messages separate from the standard output. All the log messages go to the\\nstandard error stream by default, which can conveniently show up in di\\x00erent colors. However, you can redirect log\\nmessages to separate files, even for individual modules!\\nQuite commonly, misconfigured logging can lead to running out of space on the server’s disk. To prevent that, you\\nmay set up log rotation, which will keep the log files for a specified duration, such as one week, or once they hit a\\ncertain size. Nevertheless, it’s always a good practice to archive older logs. Some regulations enforce that customer\\ndata be kept for as long as five years!\\nCompared to other programming languages, logging in Python is simpler, because the logging module is bundled\\nwith the standard library. You just import and configure it in as little as two lines of code:\\nYou can call functions defined at the module level, which are hooked to the root logger, but more the common\\npractice is to obtain a dedicated logger for each of your source files:\\nThe advantage of using custom loggers is more fine-grain control. They’re usually named a\\x00er the module they were\\ndefined in through the __name__ variable.\\nOne last reason to switch from the print() function to logging is thread safety. In the upcoming section, you’ll see\\nthat the former doesn’t play well with multiple threads of execution.\\nDebugging\\nText\\n[2019-06-14 15:18:34,517][DEBUG][root][MainThread] Customer(id=123) logged out \\nPython\\nimport logging\\nlogging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)\\nPython\\nlogging.debug('hello')  # Module-level function \\n \\nlogger = logging.getLogger(__name__)\\nlogger.debug('hello')   # Logger's method\\nNote: There’s a somewhat related warnings module in Python, which can also log messages to the standard\\nerror stream. However, it has a narrower spectrum of applications, mostly in library code, whereas client\\napplications should use the logging module.\\nThat said, you can make them work together by calling logging.captureWarnings(True).\"),\n",

To do actual debugging, you need a\\ndebugger tool, which allows you to do the following:\\nStep through the code interactively.\\nSet breakpoints, including conditional breakpoints.\\nIntrospect variables in memory.\\nEvaluate custom expressions at runtime.\\nA crude debugger that runs in the terminal, unsurprisingly named pdb for “The Python Debugger,” is distributed as\\npart of the standard library. This makes it always available, so it may be your only choice for performing remote\\ndebugging. Perhaps that’s a good reason to get familiar with it.\\nHowever, it doesn’t come with a graphical interface, so using pdb may be a bit tricky. If you can’t edit the code, you\\nhave to run it as a module and pass your script’s location:\\nOtherwise, you can set up a breakpoint directly in the code, which will pause the execution of your script and drop\\nyou into the debugger. The old way of doing this required two steps:\\nThis shows up an interactive prompt, which might look intimidating at first. However, you can still type native Python\\nat this point to examine or modify the state of local variables. Apart from that, there’s really only a handful of\\ndebugger-specific commands that you want to use for stepping through the code.\\nSince Python 3.7, you can also call the built-in breakpoint() function, which does the same thing, but in a more\\ncompact way and with some additional bells and whistles:\\nYou’re probably going to use a visual debugger integrated with a code editor for the most part. PyCharm has an\\nexcellent debugger, which boasts high performance, but you’ll find plenty of alternative IDEs with debuggers, both\\npaid and free of charge.\\nDebugging isn’t the proverbial silver bullet. Sometimes logging or tracing will be a better solution. For example,\\ndefects that are hard to reproduce, such as race conditions, o\\x00en result from temporal coupling. When you stop at a\\nbreakpoint, that little pause in program execution may mask the problem.

If you’re still\\nreading this, then you must be comfortable with the concept of threads.\\nThread safety means that a piece of code can be safely shared between multiple threads of execution. The simplest\\nstrategy for ensuring thread-safety is by sharing immutable objects only. If threads can’t modify an object’s state,\\nthen there’s no risk of breaking its consistency.\\nAnother method takes advantage of local memory, which makes each thread receive its own copy of the same object.\\nThat way, other threads can’t see the changes made to it in the current thread.\\nBut that doesn’t solve the problem, does it? You o\\x00en want your threads to cooperate by being able to mutate a\\nshared resource. The most common way of synchronizing concurrent access to such a resource is by locking it. This\\ngives exclusive write access to one or sometimes a few threads at a time.\\nHowever, locking is expensive and reduces concurrent throughput, so other means for controlling access have been\\ninvented, such as atomic variables or the compare-and-swap algorithm.\\nPrinting isn’t thread-safe in Python. The print() function holds a reference to the standard output, which is a shared\\nglobal variable. In theory, because there’s no locking, a context switch could happen during a call to\\nsys.stdout.write(), intertwining bits of text from multiple print() calls.\\nIn practice, however, that doesn’t happen. No matter how hard you try, writing to the standard output seems to be\\natomic. The only problem that you may sometimes observe is with messed up line breaks:\\nTo simulate this, you can increase the likelihood of a context switch by making the underlying .write() method go to\\nsleep for a random amount of time. How? By mocking it, which you already know about from an earlier section:\\nNote: A context switch means that one thread halts its execution, either voluntarily or not, so that another one\\ncan take over. This might happen at any moment, even in the middle of a function call.\\nText\\n[Thread-3 A][Thread-2 A][Thread-1 A] \\n \\n[Thread-3 B][Thread-1 B] \\n \\n \\n[Thread-1 C][Thread-3 C] \\n \\n[Thread-2 B] \\n[Thread-2 C] \\nPython'),\n",

Then you provide\\nyour fake implementation, which will take up to one second to execute. Each thread will make a few print() calls with\\nits name and a letter: A, B, and C.\\nIf you read the mocking section before, then you may already have an idea of why printing misbehaves like that.\\nNonetheless, to make it crystal clear, you can capture values fed into your slow_write() function. You’ll notice that\\nyou get a slightly di\\x00erent sequence each time:\\nEven though sys.stdout.write() itself is an atomic operation, a single call to the print() function can yield more than\\none write. For example, line breaks are written separately from the rest of the text, and context switching takes place\\nbetween those writes.\\nYou can make the newline character become an integral part of the message by handling it manually:\\nThis will fix the output:\\nimport sys \\n \\nfrom time import sleep\\nfrom random import random\\nfrom threading import current_thread, Thread\\nfrom unittest.mock import patch \\n \\nwrite = sys.stdout.write \\n \\ndef slow_write(text): \\n    sleep(random()) \\n    write(text) \\n \\ndef task(): \\n    thread_name = current_thread().name \\n    for letter in 'ABC': \\n        print(f'[{thread_name} {letter}]') \\n \\nwith patch('sys.stdout') as mock_stdout: \\n    mock_stdout.write = slow_write \\n    for _ in range(3): \\n        Thread(target=task).start()\\nPython\\n[ \\n    '[Thread-3 A]', \\n    '[Thread-2 A]', \\n    '[Thread-1 A]', \\n    '\\\\n', \\n    '\\\\n', \\n    '[Thread-3 B]', \\n    (...)\\n]\\nNote: The atomic nature of the standard output in Python is a byproduct of the Global Interpreter Lock, which\\napplies locking around bytecode instructions. Be aware, however, that many interpreter flavors don’t have the\\nGIL, where multi-threaded printing requires explicit locking.\\nPython\\nprint(f'[{thread_name} {letter}]\\\\n', end='')\\nText\"),\n",

The subject, however, wouldn’t be complete without\\ntalking about its counterparts a little bit. While print() is about the output, there are functions and libraries for the\\ninput.\\nBuilt-In\\nPython comes with a built-in function for accepting input from the user, predictably called input(). It accepts data\\nfrom the standard input stream, which is usually the keyboard:\\nThe function always returns a string, so you might need to parse it accordingly:\\nThe prompt parameter is completely optional, so nothing will show if you skip it, but the function will still work:\\nNevertheless, throwing in a descriptive call to action makes the user experience so much better.\\nNote: Even in single-threaded code, you might get caught up in a similar situation. Specifically, when you’re\\nprinting to the standard output and the standard error streams at the same time. Unless you redirect one or\\nboth of them to separate files, they’ll both share a single terminal window.\\nPython >>>\\n>>> import logging\\n>>> logging.basicConfig(format='%(threadName)s %(message)s')\\n>>> logging.error('hello')\\nMainThread hello\\nPython >>>\\n>>> name = input('Enter your name: ')\\nEnter your name: jdoe\\n>>> print(name)\\njdoe\\nPython\\ntry: \\n    age = int(input('How old are you? '))\\nexcept ValueError: \\n    pass\\nPython >>>\\n>>> x = input()\\nhello world\\n>>> print(x)\\nhello world\\nNote: To read from the standard input in Python 2, you have to call raw_input() instead, which is yet another\\nbuilt-in. Unfortunately, there’s also a misleadingly named input() function, which does a slightly di\\x00erent thing.\"),\n",

In this\\ncase, you should be using the getpass() function instead, which masks typed characters. This function is defined in a\\nmodule under the same name, which is also available in the standard library:\\nThe getpass module has another function for getting the user’s name from an environment variable:\\nPython’s built-in functions for handling the standard input are quite limited. At the same time, there are plenty of\\nthird-party packages, which o\\x00er much more sophisticated tools.\\nThird-Party\\nThere are external Python packages out there that allow for building complex graphical interfaces specifically to\\ncollect data from the user.

You don’t have to do anything for it to work!\\nIn fact, it also takes the input from the standard stream, but then it tries to evaluate it as if it was Python code.\\nBecause that’s a potential security vulnerability, this function was completely removed from Python 3, while\\nraw_input() got renamed to input().\\nHere’s a quick comparison of the available functions and what they do:\\nPython 2 Python 3\\nraw_input() input()\\ninput() eval(input())\\nAs you can tell, it’s still possible to simulate the old behavior in Python 3.\\nPython >>>\\n>>> from getpass import getpass\\n>>> password = getpass()\\nPassword: \\n>>> print(password)\\ns3cret\\nPython >>>\\n>>> from getpass import getuser\\n>>> getuser()\\n'jdoe'\"),\n",

They could barely make any more noises than that, yet video\\ngames seemed so much better with it.\\nToday you can still take advantage of this small loudspeaker, but chances are your laptop didn’t come with one. In\\nsuch a case, you can enable terminal bell emulation in your shell, so that a system warning sound is played instead.\\nGo ahead and type this command to see if your terminal can play a sound:\\nThis would normally print text, but the -e flag enables the interpretation of backslash escapes. As you can see, there’s\\na dedicated escape sequence \\\\a, which stands for “alert”, that outputs a special bell character. Some terminals make\\na sound whenever they see it.\\nSimilarly, you can print this character in Python. Perhaps in a loop to form some kind of melody. While it’s only a\\nsingle note, you can still vary the length of pauses between consecutive instances. That seems like a perfect toy for\\nMorse code playback!\\nThe rules are the following:\\nLetters are encoded with a sequence of dot (·) and dash (–) symbols.\\nA dot is one unit of time.\\nA dash is three units of time.\\nIndividual symbols in a letter are spaced one unit of time apart.\\nSymbols of two adjacent letters are spaced three units of time apart.\\nSymbols of two adjacent words are spaced seven units of time apart.\\nAccording to those rules, you could be “printing” an SOS signal indefinitely in the following way:\\nfrom time import sleep \\n \\ndef progress(percent=0, width=30): \\n    left = width * percent // 100 \\n    right = width - left \\n    print(\\'\\\\r[\\', \\'#\\' * left, \\' \\' * right, \\']\\', \\n          f\\' {percent:.0f}%\\', \\n          sep=\\'\\', end=\\'\\', flush=True) \\n \\nfor i in range(101): \\n    progress(i) \\n    sleep(0.1)\\nNote: There’s a feature-rich progressbar2 library, along with a few other similar tools, that can show progress in\\na much more comprehensive way.\\nShell\\n$ echo -e \"\\\\a\"\\nPython'),\n",

If you’re still\\nreading this, then you must be comfortable with the concept of threads.\\nThread safety means that a piece of code can be safely shared between multiple threads of execution. The simplest\\nstrategy for ensuring thread-safety is by sharing immutable objects only. If threads can’t modify an object’s state,\\nthen there’s no risk of breaking its consistency.\\nAnother method takes advantage of local memory, which makes each thread receive its own copy of the same object.\\nThat way, other threads can’t see the changes made to it in the current thread.\\nBut that doesn’t solve the problem, does it? You o\\x00en want your threads to cooperate by being able to mutate a\\nshared resource. The most common way of synchronizing concurrent access to such a resource is by locking it. This\\ngives exclusive write access to one or sometimes a few threads at a time.\\nHowever, locking is expensive and reduces concurrent throughput, so other means for controlling access have been\\ninvented, such as atomic variables or the compare-and-swap algorithm.\\nPrinting isn’t thread-safe in Python. The print() function holds a reference to the standard output, which is a shared\\nglobal variable. In theory, because there’s no locking, a context switch could happen during a call to\\nsys.stdout.write(), intertwining bits of text from multiple print() calls.\\nIn practice, however, that doesn’t happen. No matter how hard you try, writing to the standard output seems to be\\natomic. The only problem that you may sometimes observe is with messed up line breaks:\\nTo simulate this, you can increase the likelihood of a context switch by making the underlying .write() method go to\\nsleep for a random amount of time. How? By mocking it, which you already know about from an earlier section:\\nNote: A context switch means that one thread halts its execution, either voluntarily or not, so that another one\\ncan take over. This might happen at any moment, even in the middle of a function call.\\nText\\n[Thread-3 A][Thread-2 A][Thread-1 A] \\n \\n[Thread-3 B][Thread-1 B] \\n \\n \\n[Thread-1 C][Thread-3 C] \\n \\n[Thread-2 B] \\n[Thread-2 C] \\nPython')]"

      "Answer: The answer to the question \"What is the print function?\" is:\n",
      "\n",
      "The `print()` function in Python is a built-in function that allows you to write output to the console or a file. It takes one or more arguments, which are joined together with a default separator of newline characters (`\\n`). The `print()` function can also be used to write output to a file by specifying the filename as an argument.\n",
      "\n",
      "The `print()` function is a simple way to write output to the console or a file in Python. It is often used for debugging purposes, such as printing out the value of a variable or the result of an expression. The `print()` function can also be used to write output to a file, which can be useful for storing information for later use or sharing it with others.\n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, the `print()` function in Python is a built-in function that allows you to write output to the console or a file, and it is a simple way to debug your code and share information with others.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: What does lambda function do?\n",
      "Answer: The answer to the question is: A lambda function is an anonymous, unnamed function that can be defined inline or assigned to a variable. Lambda functions are commonly used in functional programming styles where they are often created on the fly and have a single expression body. They can also be used to create a new function object without defining a name for the function.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the context of the passage, the author uses a lambda function to demonstrate how to disable the default behavior of the `print()` function by injecting a custom callback function that does nothing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: What is Dependency?\n",
      "Answer: I'm happy to help! The term \"Dependency\" in the context of Python programming refers to any piece of code that is required by another bit of code. In other words, it is something that one module or function needs in order to function correctly.\n",
      "\n",
      "For example, in the provided code snippet, the `download()` function depends on the `lambda` expression `error()` because it needs to call that function in order to print an error message to the standard error stream. Similarly, the `custom_print()` function depends on the `download()` function because it needs to be called by that function in order to perform its intended action.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dependency injection is a technique used in code design to make it more testable, reusable, and open for extension. It involves referring to dependencies indirectly through abstract interfaces and providing them in a push rather than pull fashion. This allows for looser coupling between modules and functions, making the code more modular and easier to maintain.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: what is built-in function in python, name a few?\n",
      "Answer: I can answer the question based on the provided context. The document provides information about the Python print function and its usage, including how to use it to print to a file. It also mentions other built-in functions in Python, such as `sys.stdin`, `sys.stdout`, and `sys.stderr`.\n",
      "\n",
      "Some examples of built-in functions in Python include:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. `print()`: This function is used to print messages or values to the screen.\n",
      "2. `input()`: This function is used to receive user input from the keyboard.\n",
      "3. `len()`: This function is used to find the length of a string or other sequence.\n",
      "4. `type()`: This function is used to determine the type of an object.\n",
      "5. `sum()`: This function is used to calculate the sum of a list or other iterable.\n",
      "6. `max()` and `min()`: These functions are used to find the maximum or minimum value in a list or other iterable.\n",
      "7. `range()`: This function is used to generate a sequence of numbers.\n",
      "8. `sorted()`: This function is used to sort a list or other iterable.\n",
      "9. `map()` and `filter()`: These functions are used to apply a function to each element in a list or other iterable, or to filter out certain elements based on a condition.\n",
      "10. `zip()`: This function is used to combine multiple lists or other iterables into a single iterable.\n",

      "A function in Python is a block of code that can be called multiple times from different parts of a program. It is a way to organize and reuse code, making your program more efficient and easier to maintain. Functions can take arguments, which are values passed to the function when it is called, and they can return values after executing the code inside them.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here are some key points to know about Python functions:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Functions are defined using the `def` keyword. For example, `def greet(name): print(\"Hello, \" + name)` defines a function called `greet` that takes a single argument `name`.\n",
      "2. Functions can have a variable number of arguments. In the previous example, `greet` can be called with any number of arguments, such as `greet(\"Alice\")`, `greet(\"Bob\", \"Charlie\")`, or `greet(\"Alice\", \"Bob\")` .\n",
      "3. Functions can return multiple values. For example, `def add(x, y): return x + y, x * y` defines a function called `add` that returns two values: the sum of `x` and `y`, and the product of `x` and `y`.\n",
      "4. Functions can use variables from the global scope. If a function needs to access a variable that is defined outside of the function, it can use the `global` keyword. For example, `def greet(name): global greetings; greetings = \"Hello, \" + name` defines a function called `greet` that accesses the `greetings` variable from the global scope.\n",
      "5. Functions can be assigned to variables. For example, `my_function = add` assigns the function `add` to a variable called `my_function`. This can be useful for storing functions in a data structure and calling them later.\n",
      "6. Functions can be called from other functions. For example, `def double(x): return x * 2; def triple(x): return triple(double(x))` defines two functions: `double` that takes a single argument `x` and returns its double, and `triple` that takes a single argument `x` and returns its triple.\n",
      "7. Functions can be used in a loop. For example, `for x in range(5): greet(x)` calls the `greet` function five times with different values of `x`.\n",
      "8. Functions can take advantage of Python's typing system. For example, `def get_name(name: str): return name` defines a function called `get_name` that takes a single argument `name` of type `str`. This allows the function to infer the type of the argument and returns a value of the same type.\n",
      "9. Functions can be decorated with metadata. For example, `def @log(x): print(x)` defines a function called `@log` that takes a single argument `x` and logs it to the console. This allows other functions to wrap around the `@log` function and add their own logging logic without modifying the original function.\n",
      "10. Functions can be used in combination with other language features, such as classes and modules. For example, `class Person: def greet(name): return f\"Hello, {name}!\"` defines a class called `Person` that has a method called `greet` that takes a single argument `name` and returns a string message.\n",
      "\n",
      "These are just some of the basics of Python functions. Of course, there are many more advanced features and techniques to learn, but this should give you a good starting point for your journey into the world of Python functionland!"
